            This is <strong>Trials of Dark Souls 3</strong>, a digital sanctuary forged by a fan for those brave enough to walk the path toward the flame — and the platinum.
        </p>
        <p>
            The purpose of this site is singular: to help you achieve the <strong>Platinum Trophy</strong> in <em>Dark Souls III</em>. Within these pages lies a simple yet powerful checklist system that you can use to track your journey through Lothric.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's important to note: <strong>this is not a wiki</strong>. You won’t find detailed guides on weapon or shield locations, or anything that isn't directly related to earning the platinum.
        </p>
        <p>
            Everything here is designed with one goal in mind: <strong>100% completion</strong>. <strong>Bosses, rings, gestures, endings, spells, miracles, infusions, covenants...</strong> Each section represents a category that must be conquered.
        </p>
        <p>
            The intention is to provide a <strong>practical checklist</strong>. As you progress through the game, mark what you’ve achieved and stay focused on what’s left to do.
        </p>
        <p>
            This journey won’t be easy. But the fact that you're here means you're ready.
        </p>

            <em>“The flame fades... but you, Ashen one, do not.”</em><br>
            <strong>Claim your destiny.</strong>
